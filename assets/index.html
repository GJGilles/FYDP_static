            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">We are a party of aspiring dungeoneers hailing from the Stronghold of
              Engineering 5. Last September we embarked on an epic 8-month quest to conquer Mount Capstone. After
              levelling up for the last 5 years we are ready to revolutionize the tabletop gaming experience with
              Project Merlin!</p>

          <h5>Glennarthyr Gillespie - Gnome Wizard</h5>
          <p>Fluent in the arcane languages of JavaScript and Python, Glenn has the ability to command inanimate
            objects to do his bidding! Fortunately for us, he chooses to use this power to bring Project Merlin to
            life. With a +3 Keyboard of Coding he’s been writing his own magical tomes non-stop, though none of us know
            quite enough magic to understand them.</p>

            showing up with shiny new parts. He won’t say where he’s getting these parts from, but they seem to be just
            what we need to put Project Merlin together. Rumour has it that he uses electromancy to put a little more
            oomph into John’s Dwarven mechanisms.</p>

            core of Project Merlin. With a magic toolbelt at his waist and a +2 Caffeine Potion in hand, he’s busy
            getting stuff done all hours of the day. John and his unlikely Elven ally, Keenan, worked together to build
            the tabletop gaming rig of our dreams!</p>

            Despite their differences, he and his Dwarven friend, John, worked closely to draw up plans and build
            Project Merlin from scratch. He says he doesn’t know any Elven magic, but how else could he move around and
            work so fast?</p>

              <h3>Software Update 1: 2 Feb 2019</h3>
              <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="img/wk_1/Overview.PNG" alt="Responsive image">
              <p>
                The software has made a great deal of progress since the beginning of the project. Much of the user
                interface software and main functionality is done, just leaving the hardware communication layer for
                later development and testing.
                Above is shown an overview of the user interface as it appears currently. All buttons and interfaces
                are fully functional to a firmware level, except for scanning which will come later. Currently users
                can click on the main canvas area
                of the application in order to add new tasks to the task queue. Simply clicking two squares one after
                another will result in the table moving from one square to another.
              </p>
              <img class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" src="img/wk_1/Task_Queue.PNG" alt="Responsive image">
              <p>
                This shows the task queue, where the list of movements to be done by the table are listed and updated
                over time as they are completed.
                The user will have the ability to pause the current task, remove tasks from the queue and reorder tasks
                which are not currently playing.
              </p>
              <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-6"><img class="img-fluid rounded  mx-auto d-block" src="img/wk_1/Pawn_Edit.PNG" alt="Responsive image"></div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                  This screen show how the user can edit the appearance and description of individual pawns in order to
                  customize their experience. There are plans in the future to make the selection of pawns on the pawn
                  list and the canvas more intuitive.
                </div>
              </div>
              <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="img/wk_1/Macro_Edit.PNG" alt="Responsive image">
              <p>
                Macros were originally a desired but non essential feature, but they are currently implemented in the
                current software version! Macros allow for the user to go into an edit mode and add a group of tasks,
                then save them as a Macro.
                At a later time a Macro can be deployed in order to automatically queue the group of moves that were
                predefined for it. Time permitting, this could be greatly improved upon in the future.
              </p>
              <img class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" src="img/wk_1/Image_Modal.PNG" alt="Responsive image">
              <p>
                Part of this project involves displaying images on the tabletop. In order to accomodate this, users can
                now upload their own images yo manually set the table background. This also updates the background of
                the canvas in the software so
                that the user will be able to more easily move between the app and the tabletop.
              </p>
              <h3>Future Work</h3>
              <p>
                The most major update planned for the near future focuses on improving the performance of the server
                code on the raspberry pi, as it is currently struggling under the heavy load.
                The current proposed solution is to switch the pi so that it is only running a simple server so that
                the main server can run in a more robust environment and only exchange simple data with the pi.
              </p>
              <p>
                Work is also being done to improve the user interface in several small ways. Such as: Different views
                for players and the game master, loading bars for playing tasks and a better mobile layout.
